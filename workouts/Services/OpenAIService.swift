        The muscle system of the body is a complex system that is not only made of muscles but also joints, ligaments, tendons, etc. It is imperative that the user takes care of the whole system, not only the muscles, especially because an injury in one part of the body can lead to an injury in other parts of the body.

        [[Active Muscle Recovery]]

        Once per month:
        [[Physiotherapy]]
        [[Sleep]]

        The real focus of the [[Fitness Plan]] is to maintain a high enough [[Fitness]] level to be able to play any [[Sports]] or get any of my [[Goals]] done at any given point in time during my life.


        ================================================
        File: 2. Appendices/Tracking Progress.md
        ================================================
        No track of weight or times will be made. We will constantly use Apple Health, the Fitness app and Fitness+, and the custom Workout app developed by me to track progress, thus an Apple Watch and an iPhone are key for this [[Fitness]] progress to be tracked.

        We will also get an InBody complete measurement once every 2 months if possible, so that we can track body weight, fat percentage, muscle and fat concentration and other very important metrics.

        Even if smart sources are amazing at letting us know how we are improving, Iit is imperative that the athlete listens to their body to find the correct effort and energy needed for getting workouts done so that we constantly work on our [[Mindfulness]] and [[Mind Muscle Connection]]. [[Sports and Goals]] performance is also a very good and important factor in determining if the [[Fitness]] level is improving.

        Lastly, we can also run [[Test Days]] to switch things up in the gym and also track how our [[Fitness]] is doing.
